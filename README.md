# Swan-Browser 
A simple web browser for Android & Windows 10/11.
The Android version is coded from scratch (non Chromium based) with _something like_ tab support.
The Windows version is made on .NET 10 & WebView2 with tab support _better than the Android version_.
      The WedView may create some temporary files, you can just delete them.
